# improve1984
An English project that describes improvements to technology in George Orwell's 1984 (a dystopia).
The goal is to describe changes to technology in 1984 that will create a utopia; this is a "poster" to go along with a presentation.

The mobile version in the second part doesn't really work... but for my purposes it'll be fine. ¯\_(°—°)_/¯
